### Open Access Days 2017: 11 - 13 September 2017, Dresden, Germany

This event is the meeting place for Open Access experts from Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as researchers, publishers and supporter of scietific research communication processes in libraries and research organisations.
On Tuesday, 12 September the workshop "Wie vermessen ist das Vermessen von wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation?" takes place. Social media platforms allow sharing, commenting as well as subscribing to discussions. These interactions are a measure for reception of scientific output. They are more and more in a position to reflect impact of research results in parallel to established metrics (e.g. citation based indicators like the Journal Impact Factor). Because traditional metrics have a number of drawbacks (time delays, not article based, not transparent or at least difficult to reproduce) the search for and research on new metrics is a dynamic field. The \*metrics project contributes to this by analysing meaning and interpretation of such metrics. During this workshop first results of the project which started in January will be presented.
Please find detailed information in the [conference programm](https://open-access.net/community/open-access-tage/open-access-tage-2017-dresden/programm/). A registration for the workshop is not necessary, however registration for the Open Access Days is mandatory.


## Past Events

### Annual LIBER Conference 2017: 5 - 7 July 2017, Patras, Greece

The [Annual LIBER Conference](http://liber2017.lis.upatras.gr/) took place from 5 - 7 July in Patras, Greece and was hosted by the Library & Information Centre of the University of Patras. \*metrics team member [Isabella Peters]({{ site.url }}/en/uber_uns/team/) organised a [workshop](http://liber2017.lis.upatras.gr/workshops/) of the LIBER Metrics working group.
The working group has worked towards compiling recommendations on how libraries can get started with impact metrics. During the workshop the draft recommendations were presented and discussed with the LIBER community. Furthermore various use cases for Metrics services were presented, and participants engaged in interactive workshop elements.

### 9th International ACM Web Science Conference 2017 (WebSci’17): 25 - 28 June 2017, Troy, NY, USA

The [WebSci'17 conference](http://websci17.org/) brought together researchers from multiple disciplines, like computer science, sociology, economics, information science, or psychology. Web Science is the emergent study of the people and technologies, applications, processes and practices that shape and are shaped by the World Wide Web. Web Science aims to draw together theories, methods and findings from across academic disciplines, and to collaborate with industry, business, government and civil society, to develop our knowledge and understanding of the Web: the largest socio-technical infrastructure in human history.
\*metrics team member [Olga Zagovora]({{ site.url }}/en/uber_uns/team/) has been at WebSci'17.

### Bibliothekartag: 1 June 2017, Frankfurt

On June 1, 2017 Daniel Beucke moderated the workshop "Altmetrics and what am I doing with it?" at this year's [Bibliothekartag](http://bibliothekartag2017.de/) from May 30 - June 2, 2017 in Frankfurt/Main. After a general introduction into the topic of altmetrics, Astrid Orth explained how the interested community benefits from results of the \*metrics project.  
In addition, related services and tools have been outlined. After this national focus international working groups and initiatives which are working on standardising alternative metrics have been introduced.  

Ben McLeish from [Altmetric.com](https://www.altmetric.com/) demonstrated the current state of research in Germany regarding the trends that can be derived using data based on altmetrics. What is being discussed in social media channels? Which data is buried in policy documents and which institutions feature most or least, respectively? How can these experiences be applied to public relations and the communications strategy of an organisation? Christina Lohr from [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) on the other hand outlined based on collected data how altmetrics can be used to achieve impact in social media for social sciences and humanities, and there specifically for books as a publishing medium.  
Presentations are [available here](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-bib-info/solrsearch/index/search/searchtype/collection/id/16603).


### WikiCite: 23-25 May 2017, Vienna

[WikiCite 2017](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite_2017) was a 3-day conference, summit and hack day to be hosted in Vienna, Austria, from May 23-25, 2017. It expanded efforts to design a central bibliographic repository, as well as tools and strategies to improve information quality and verifiability in Wikimedia projects. Wikimedia contributors met with data modelers, information and library science experts, software engineers, designers and academic researchers who have experience working with Wikipedia's citations and bibliographic data.  

Olga Zagovora introduced the \*metrics project to the Wikipedia community and presented some preliminary first results of the project. It has been beneficial to both, the Wikipedians being one of the focal creators of altmetrics, as well as the project team to increase awareness for the ongoing \*metrics project. Moreover, exchanging experiences with citation mining experts during the hackathon gained useful insights for our future work.  

The main focus of the presentation of the study [“Do Wikipedia Science Articles reflect on state-of-the-art research”]({{ sitebase.url }}/downloads/wikicite_lightning_talk_zagovora.pdf) was to present ongoing research on Wikipedia articles about social science topics. The objective of the study is to observe whether encyclopedia articles reflect state-of-the-art research. This becomes possible by studying alternative and classical citation metrics in the field.

### COAR Annual Meeting: 8 - 10 May 2017, Venice

This year's [General Assembly of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR)](https://www.coar-repositories.org/community/coar-annual-meeting-2017/) took place from 8 - 10 May 2017 in Venice on the campus of the Università Ca’ Foscari. The major theme for this meeting was next generation repositories. The meeting provided participants with the opportunity to learn about international trends in repositories, open access and open science, as well as engage with colleagues from around the world.  

The COAR Open Metrics Interest Group had a meeting moderated by co-chair and \*metrics project manager Astrid Orth to discuss latest developments in the area of alternative metrics and introduce the \*metrics project. The project also presented a [poster]({{ site.url }}/downloads/coar2017_metrics_poster.pdf) during the conference.


### International Open Science Conference 2017: 20 - 22 March, Berlin

The International Open Science Conference 21 - 22 March 2017 attracted a broad audience to Berlin. Three \*metrics project team members participated in the event.  

On the day before, the Open Science Policy Plattform met to receive the [Report of the European Expert Group on Altmetrics]({{ site.url }}/en/news/2017-03-20-report-of-eu-expert-group-on-altmetrics-published/). Isabella Peters together with her co-authors presented details of the paper during the Open Science Conference.  

The Open Science Barcamp was also held on 20th March. A very fruitful [Open Metrics Session]({{ site.url }}/en/news/2017-03-20-metrics-at-ocsibar17/) was moderated by Astrid Orth. Of particular use was the discussion during the workshop "Scientific knowledge dissemination and altmetrics" held by the EU project OpenUp where further co-ordination and co-operation was agreed.
