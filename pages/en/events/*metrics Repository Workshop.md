The \*metrics team is proud to announce the first workshop in 2018!  
It will precede the [COAR annual meeting](https://www.coar-repositories.org/community/coar-annual-meeting-2018/) in Hamburg, Germany.  
The workshop will be dissected into two parts (14 May2018 2pm-5pm and 15 May 2018 9am-1pm)
and focus on different uses metrics can provide in varying scenarios. So, it is especially informative for 
members of COAR-organizations and everyone interested in the topic of repositories and/or the \*metrics project.
[Registration is possible via COAR](https://www.coar-repositories.org/community/coar-annual-meeting-2018/registration/).  
Further information will follow.  
  
### ZBW  
The workshop will take place in the ZBW building. The Leibniz Information Centre for 
Economics is not only one of our project partners, but also the world&#39;s biggest information
centre concerned with literature on the topic of economics. The ZBW is an advocate of open science 
and open access and does research in both areas.  
  
### Location  
The ZBW is located in Hamburg&#39;s city centre by the Binnenalster river.
