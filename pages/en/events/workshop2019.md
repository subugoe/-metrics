The \*metrics project  invites you and everyone interested in \*metrics to its final workshop which will take place in the Historical Building of Göttingen State and University Library.

On March 27 & 28, 2019 the project team will present the results of 2 years work and would like to discuss the topic further with the community. Moreover the actual research in this field will be presented and cooperation networks for sustainability and further development of the services should be initiated.  

We are happy to present our two **keynote speakers**:
   
### Joe Wass and Catriona MacCallum.
