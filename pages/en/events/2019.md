The 2019 [LIS-Bibliometrics event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lis-bibliometrics-forum-open-metrics-and-measuring-openness-registration-52053342950) focused 
on open metrics and measuring openness. It aimed to provide a forum for practitioners to hear, share, discuss and debate how open metrics
can be introduced, developed and used and how to measure openness and its 
impact. \*metrics Team member [Isabella Peters](https://metrics-project.net/en/uber_uns/team/) held a keynote presentation
called [" Measuring openness â€“ why measure openness and how do we do it"](https://zenodo.org/record/2552145#.XGLxplxKjct).
