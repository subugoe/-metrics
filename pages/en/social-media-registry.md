## Current Status of Social Media Plattforms and \*metrics

In this task \*metrics will develop a registry of social media platforms that are used for scholarly communication. The registry will include platforms that were created specifically for scientific use, as well as general purpose platforms that are now commonly used by scientists for dissemination of their research results. For all services, we will describe:

  * which functions of scholarly communication they support,
  * which interactions are possible, and
<!--  * what meaning would metrics possess, that build upon capturing these interactions.-->
  * what meaningful metrics possess could build upon capturing these interactions.

The registry will also provide a detailed overview on currently offered \*metrics aggregators and a comparision of the information that is offered by these services.
This development will support two other important tasks in the project
  1. Analyse user-groups of social media services as well as their perceptions and assessment of alternative indicators, and
  2. Create prototypical queries of social media services to capture interactions that could produce open and transparent metrics
  
The bilingual Social Media Registry will be developed by project team members in co-operation with the scientific community. Initially, a beta version has been developed by the project team as a Google Doc. This serves as a place to collect input from a broad audience and is supposed to not only gather content, but to find a technically more sophisticated solution, as well.

For comments and additions the registry can be reached under the following link:

Feedback continues to be collected at workshops and events.
