## Status Quo of Social Media Plattforms and \*metrics

Here we develop a registry of social media platforms that are used for science communication. Among those will be platforms that were created specifically with scientific use in mind, as well as general public platforms that are now commonly used by scientists for dissemination of their research results. For all services it will be considered

  * which function of science communication they support,
  * which interactions are possible, and
  * what meaning would metrics possess, that build upon capturing these interactions.

Thus it will also be possible to give a detailed overview on currently offered \*metrics aggregators and a comparision of the information that is offered by these services.
This development will support both other important tasks in the project
  1. Analyse user groups of social media services as well as their perceptions and assessment of alternative indicators, and
  2. Create prototypical queries of social media services to capture interactions that could result into open and transparent metrics

The bilingual Social Media Registry will be developed by project team members in co-operation with the scientific community. A first version suggested by the project team will be launched in September 2017 on our website. Early versions will be available for pre-view at workshops and events to collect feedback from a broad audience. Once launched, the registry will be open for comments and amendments.
