Our team is distributed over four institutions: Goettingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen), Leibniz Information Centre for Economics (ZBW), Common Library Network of the German States Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thüringen and the Foundation of Prussian Cultural Heritage (VZG) and the Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences (GESIS). The team meets regularly virtually and in person and works closely together.
