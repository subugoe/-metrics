## Proposal Summary

The main objective of this project proposal is to develop a deeper
understanding of *metrics, especially in terms of their general
significance and their perception amongst stakeholders. To this end,
key considerations will include the quality of *metrics underlying data
(in terms of validity and reliability), the historical context within which
*metrics arose, as well as their ability to adequately assess scientific
outputs against the background of disciplinary specificities. The
project's findings will benefit *metrics users (e.g., researchers,
research funders), information services and libraries, as well as
*metrics providers, enabling *metrics informed use and widening our
knowledge about their limitations and possibilities for interpretation. A
publicly-funded project such as *metrics also guarantees
transparency and open access to project results, which is not the
norm among commercial providers in this area. Therefore, the project
will contribute to the greater openness and transparency of *metrics
initiatives, help shape the *metrics debate, forge alliances with
commercial *metrics providers and include important target groups
such as researchers and information services in *metrics future
development. Project aims include the analysis and evaluation of
*metrics origins as well as their perception amongst stakeholders. The
parallel consideration of these research priorities will enable the
drawing of broad conclusions regarding *metrics significance, leading
to increased transparency and their better understanding. To achieve
this, the project will be based on two broad, complementary
methodological approaches. Firstly, Work Package 1 "Status Quo and
Explorative User/Usage Studies" will conduct user studies with the
help of content platforms including EconStor and SSOAR. This work
package will also analyse the current state of affairs regarding social
media platforms and *metrics, building a "Social Media Registry",
which will underpin both methodological approaches and be created
by the the scientific community in cooperation with the project
members. The second approach includes the assessment of *metrics
technical foundations, to be carried out in Work Package 2
"Technological Analysis for the Collection and Provision of *metrics".
This methodological work will be supported by a scientific committee
and accompanied by community building and public relations
activities, the creation of new links with national and international
initiatives (e.g. COAR, NISO) and the establishment of a *metrics
information platform (Work Package 3 "Community Building"). The
goal here is to take advantage of the project partners excellent
networks in order to enable the early dissemination of project results
to community members and hence the gathering of stakeholderfeedback.
