# Interview with Stacy Konkiel about altmetrics


## Why would someone want to find out if the research is relevant?


## How do you traditionally measure if a specific scientific output is any good?


## How many different signals are there?



## How can one measure altmetrics? Is there a standard yet? Is there a website that makes sense of all the noise?



## Some people seem to be really skeptic about altmetrics. Can you understand this criticism and how do you encounter this criticism?
