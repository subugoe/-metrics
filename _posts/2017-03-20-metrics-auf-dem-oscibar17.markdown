*metrics Project attended the Open Science Barcamp 2017

On 20 March 2017 a number of dedicated Open Science enthusiasts assembles at the Wikimedia offices in Berlin. In lively discussions we dealt with topics like MOOCs, Open Educational Ressources, Open Science practices and Alternative/Open Metrics (session list can be found in the master etherpad at https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/barcamp_open_science_2017).

Astrid Orth held a session about Open Metrics. In short during the discussion we delt with the following topics and ideas:  

Should open metrics complement or substitute traditional metrics and how?  

Calculating more numbers is probably not the solution, transparency on the meaning and interpretation of numbers is needed.  

New metrics have a number of advantages over traditional, citation based numbers.  

Awareness-raising among researchers will also help in adopting open metrics.  

Expect some of answers on this over the next 2 years from the *metrics project.
